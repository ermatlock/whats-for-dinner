# What's For Dinner? A random meal generator with an emphasis on responsive design.

# Description

This site allows the user to select from a choice of sides, main dishes, and desserts. Just click the "let's cook" button and receive a random food you can either prepare or dream about! The browser window is also fully scaleable and will switch over to a mobile arrangement for portrait aspect devices.

## Getting Started

Upon loading you are greeted with a streamlined page:

On the left hand side you can select from three choices: Sides, Main Dish, and Dessert. After choosing, click the let's cook button. You will see the loader as it comes up with a delicious meal, then a randomized result for that meal type. Let's try a side:

Now let's try a main dish:

Let's try a dessert:

Finally, the user can clear their result and start over at any time. if the user forgets to do so, no worries, it will simply update with a new meal.
